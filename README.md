# Auction Web

A dynamic live auction platform that enables real-time bidding and interactive user engagement. The frontend is built with Vite for fast, modern performance, while Socket.IO powers live bid updates, ensuring users see bids as they happen. The application combines real-time functionality, secure authentication, and a responsive design to provide a seamless online auction experience.
